Kernel System Calls
-------------------
First, checking my computer version with uname -m, then I downloaded it with the wget link, and I got "whatIdo" file.
I tried to strace it and got an error, so I did chmod to give my self permissions to strace it.
It creates a folder: welcomeToDevOpsTheHardWay, and then I did 'cd' to that directory and also 'ls' it shows me 'GoodLuck' file.
'cat GoodLuck' = There you go... tell me what I do...



Broken Symlink
-------------------
To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the symbolic link ('latest-backup.obj') always points
to the correct location. $(pwd)/$backup/latest-backup.obj



Binary Numbers
--------------
111 - 7
100 - 4
10110 - 22

The range of values that can be represented by an 8-bit binary number is from 0-255.
This includes 256 different values in total.

To represent numbers from -255 to 255 using 9 bits:
Use the two's complement representation.
The leftmost bit indicates the sign - 0 for positive, 1 for negative.
The remaining 8 bits represent the magnitude of the number.

To represent floating-point numbers using 8 bits:
Use 4 bits for the integer part and 4 bits for the fractional part.
